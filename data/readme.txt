COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset

In the past couple months, we’ve witnessed doctors, nurses, paramedics and thousands of medical workers putting their lives on the frontline to save patients who are infected. And as the battle with COVID-19 continues, we should all ask ourselves – What should we do to help out? What can we do to protect our loved ones, those who sacrifice for us, and ourselves from this pandemic?

These questions all relate back to the CORD-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge Task Question: “What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?”

And my simple answer is : We need to protect our families and our own healths by adapting to a healthy diet.

Inspiration and Research Objectives

The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but are we really eating in the healthy eating style recommended by these food divisions and balances?

In this dataset, I have combined data of different types of food, world population obesity and undernourished rate, and global COVID-19 cases count from around the world in order to learn more about how a healthy eating style could help combat the Corona Virus. And from the dataset, we can gather information regarding diet patterns from countries with lower COVID infection rate, and adjust our own diet accordingly.

In each of the 4 datasets below, I have calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal), food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). I've also added on the obesity and undernourished rate (also in percentage) for comparison. The end of the datasets also included the most up to date confirmed/deaths/recovered/active cases (also in percentage of current population for each country).

Summary: 
    5 files
    130 columns

1. Fat_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv

This dataset shows the percentages of fat consumed from each type of food listed. The end of the dataset also includes obesity and undernourished percentage, and the percentage of COVID-19 Confirmed/Deaths/Recovered/Active cases. (Note: All the data have unit % except Population, which is just the population count).

2. Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data.csv

This dataset shows the percentages of food supply (in kg) for each type of food listed. The end of the dataset also includes obesity and undernourished percentage, and the percentage of COVID-19 Confirmed/Deaths/Recovered/Active cases. (Note: All the data have unit % except Population, which is just the population count).

3. Food_Supply_kcal_Data.csv

This dataset shows the percentages of energy (in kilo calories) consumed from each type of food listed. The end of the dataset also includes obesity and undernourished percentage, and the percentage of COVID-19 Confirmed/Deaths/Recovered/Active cases. (Note: All the data have unit % except Population, which is just the population count).

4. Protein_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv

This dataset shows the percentages of protein consumed from each type of food listed. The end of the dataset also includes obesity and undernourished percentage, and the percentage of COVID-19 Confirmed/Deaths/Recovered/Active cases. (Note: All the data have unit % except Population, which is just the population count).

5. Supply_Food_Data_Descriptions.csv

This dataset is obtained from FAO.org, and is used to show the specific types of food that belongs to each category for the above datasets.
